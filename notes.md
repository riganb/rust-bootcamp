- Run `cargo init` to initialise a Rust project.
- The `Cargo.toml` file is like `package.json`, but for Rust projects. Contains configuration and external packages / dependencies.
- And `main.rs` is similar to `index.js`, basically the entrypoint for the project.
- If we create the project using `cargo init --lib`, then it will create a library project that other projects can use, but doesn't run independently / standalone.
- On WSL, had to install the required build dependencies using `sudo apt install build-essential` to make the command `cargo run` work.
- Running `cargo run` builds the project and executes the entrypoint file, `main.rs`.
- Running `cargo run` is equivalent to running these 2 commands in succession:
  1. `cargo build`
  2. `./target/debug/rust-bootcamp`
- The built project is placed inside the `debug` folder as it is a local build.
- Running `cargo build --release` will generate an optimized production build inside `release` folder rather than `debug`.
- The `Cargo.lock` file is similar to lockfiles generated by Node.js projects, not to be touched manually.
- This marks the end of notes for structural setup and execution.
